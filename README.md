Developed by [RZ1](https://github.com/THE-RZ1-x)

## Overview

A sophisticated vulnerability scanner that leverages artificial intelligence to analyze and detect security vulnerabilities in network services and systems. This tool combines traditional scanning techniques with AI-powered analysis to provide comprehensive security assessments.

## Features

- AI-powered vulnerability analysis using Google's Gemini API
- Advanced port scanning and service detection
- Multiple security API integrations (Vulners, Shodan, etc.)
- Detailed security reports and recommendations
- Asynchronous scanning for improved performance
- Fallback mechanisms when AI services are unavailable

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)
- API keys for enhanced functionality:
  - Google Gemini API key
  - Vulners API key
  - Shodan API key (optional)
  - Other security API keys (optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/THE-RZ1-x/Ai_Vuln_Scanner.git
cd Ai_Vuln_Scanner
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your API keys:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your API keys to the `.env` file

## Usage

Basic scan:
```bash
python vulnscanner.py -t <target> -s basic
```

Advanced scan:
```bash
python vulnscanner.py -t <target> -s advanced
```

Options:
- `-t, --target`: Target IP or hostname
- `-s, --scan-type`: Scan type (basic/advanced)
- `-h, --help`: Show help message

## Output

The scanner generates detailed reports in both JSON and text formats, saved in the `scans` directory. Reports include:
- Discovered services and versions
- Potential vulnerabilities
- AI-powered security analysis
- Mitigation recommendations

# Important Note About Gemini API

The Google Gemini API is currently only available in certain regions (US, UK, Canada). If you're in an unsupported region, you have two options:

1. Use a VPN with an endpoint in a supported country (recommended for full AI capabilities)
2. Run without the Gemini API (the scanner will use built-in analysis capabilities)
